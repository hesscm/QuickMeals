# QuickMeals

## CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT 10/18/21

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

Can’t decide what’s for dinner? QuickMeals is a random recipe picker/meal planner App with help from the spoonacular API. If you just want to quickly find a recipe without thinking, you can randomly search for recipes on the Recipe Generator page. If not, you can plan meals for one day or the entire week. You can then take that meal plan and generate a shopping list. If you find a recipe that you love, you can also save it to your favorites.

### Visit: Heroku Deployment Coming Soon

## Scope Document
See: [Scope Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-JiniI-LnAbEoI7cYLXNBrbgpZj1vpY2_2h-W1HLSms/edit#heading=h.vhvkcjgwsn55)

This has the details of all of my initial planning. This includes wireframes for each feature, scheduling estimates for each piece of the project, my server routes, and my technologies used.
